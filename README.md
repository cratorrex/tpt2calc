Check the Releases section to download the calculator.
##### `Update 0.3MPA` allows support for "short named" and "scientific" notations! (on top of full notation) `NEW!!`
###### Unsure of how to make it into a web application so if anyone wants to, feel free!


## EraXPCalculator
  Basically calculates the expected amount of xp you'd get from era enemies.<br/>
  The form is pretty straightforward.<br/><br/>
  The xp formula only works on era, so if you are in `inf1 era1`, the formula in game assumes you are at `era1`
 
 
## ElementDisableCalc
  Calculates the cost of elemental disables based off the base cost.
  This utility assumes that all elements' base cost is the same.
  
 If you need to know what the cost of an element as your nth disable is, enter in your base cost and click calculate and match the corresponding values. (I don't have a proficiency at explaining things ;-;)
 
  Notation for large numbers returned from the calculation is `Scientific`
 

## ClearSpeedCalculator
 ### Helps calculate your average clearspeed based on:
  - Your total Enemy kills in the run.
    - or allow the calculator to approximate kills based on one element's kill count
  - How long you were in that run `in game time`.
    - <s>if you're using real time, please click the checkbox before pressing Calculate.</s>
      - (removed in `0.3MPA`. sorry for any inconveniences caused. ping me `@cratorrex.rx#3589` on discord if you want me to add it back)
  - Which region you're in.
  
   Note: The result of the calculation will be more accurate with more kills and time spent in the run.
      The clearspeed should be the same throughout all your rounds regardless of region.
